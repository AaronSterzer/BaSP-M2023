WEEK 2 (HTML ABOUT FIGMA'S PAGE)

This week started with the material asynchronous and the class of tutors then we had a planning class talking about HTML and how to apply in the landing page.


## HTML

- Start download the [VisualCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download),[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Github](https://github.com/)
- Next create an account on Github, create a repository [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGK-lWIs3sA&ab_channel=RadiumRocketLearning)
- Then open the visualcode and create a file on your desk.
- Execute the "git bush" in that file (right click in the carpet)
- For start you have to link your github on git: "[Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc&ab_channel=TraversyMedia)"
- Before you start with the code learn about HTML in this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE&ab_channel=TraversyMedia)
- Now with your git linked to your github repository open the visual code and start the HTML code
- I recommend create other repository to practice your "skills" on sintaxys code.
- Also keep in mind "have good practices" about your code.
